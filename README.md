# Supply-Chain-in-Solidity
A supply chain smart contract implementation in solidity.
In this project I implement a smart contract in Solidity in which a coffee supply company can use it to keep 
track of their products, ensure their data integrity and business operations and maintain transparency. This project was part of my Data Science Master Studies at University of Piraeus.
